# christianle-website

This is the website from the homework that I modelled to replicate the one that it's suppose to look like in the original. 

I cleaned up some of the css so they would all be more normalized, changed some of the class tags to make things more uniform, and commented on every section of the css.

Below will be an image of how I made the website look and will also provide a link to the deployed application.
